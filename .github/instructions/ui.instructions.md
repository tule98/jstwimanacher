🎨 Overall UI Style Guide

This guide ensures a consistent visual system, acting as a “design compass” to keep your UI clean and predictable.

🎯 Visual Identity
🎨 Color System

• Primary Blue – The hero color
– Use a calm pastel blue for branding
– Ensure high contrast between text and background

• Supporting Pastel Colors – soft tones
– Good for backgrounds and states
– Helps keep the UI flat and relaxing

Tip: Always check contrast ratio to ensure accessibility.

🔤 Typography

• Use high text contrast
– Dark text on light backgrounds or light text on dark blocks
• Prefer simple geometric fonts
• Maintain a clear visual hierarchy
• Keep letter spacing slightly tight to match dense UI

📐 Layout Density

• Dense spacing
– Smaller margins
– Compact padding
• Helps create an efficient layout, especially for data-heavy screens

Note: Dense ≠ clutter. Keep some breathing space to avoid overwhelming users.

🟦 Shape & Components

• Flat design
– Avoid heavy shadows
– Use subtle borders or soft contrast blocks

🧱 Component Examples

• Buttons
– Primary: pastel blue background + dark text
– Secondary: muted pastel outline + blue text

• Cards
– Minimal elevation
– Rounded corners
– Dense padding

• Inputs
– Flat borders
– Clear focus state using darker blue

🧭 Interaction Style

• Keep animations subtle
• Use color instead of shadows to show states
• Provide immediate feedback with contrast changes
